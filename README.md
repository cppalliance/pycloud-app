Demo EXE HTTP Service
=====================

This is a simple HTTP service that can be used to demonstrate the use of PyInstaller to create an executable from a Python script that is a web server. The components of the service are:

- A `cli.py` Python script that prints hello world for the user.
- A `README.md` file that describes the service and how to use it.
- A `LICENSE` file that contains the MIT license for the service.
- A `requirements.txt` file that lists the Python packages required by the service.
- A `requirements.in` file that is used to generate the `requirements.txt` file.
- A `Makefile` that contains targets for building and cleaning the service.
- A `make.bat` file that contains targets for building and cleaning the service on Windows.
